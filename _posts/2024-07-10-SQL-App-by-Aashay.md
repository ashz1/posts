## SQL Database Operations Demo

### Introduction

I’ve created a simple CRUD SQL demo app using SQLite3 to demonstrate SQL queries. This data is based on my experience as a business and data analyst in India, although I’ve altered it significantly for demonstration purposes.

### App Overview

The app, built using Python's Streamlit library, allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on two datasets: one from Flipkart and one from Amazon. It provides an interactive interface for viewing, searching, updating, and deleting data, along with the SQL queries used.

### Key Features

1. **Home Page**
   - Overview of the app and its capabilities.
   - [Visit the Home Page](https://sqlproject.streamlit.app/)

2. **Select Operation**
   - Perform select queries to fetch specific data.
   - Learn how to use `SELECT` statements to retrieve data from a database.

3. **Insert Operation**
   - Add new records to the database.
   - Understand how to use `INSERT INTO` statements to add data.

4. **Update Operation**
   - Update existing records in the database.
   - Explore `UPDATE` statements to modify existing data.

5. **Delete Operation**
   - Delete records from the database.
   - Use `DELETE FROM` statements to remove data.

6. **Join Operations**
   - Perform various join operations like Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, and Full Join.
   - Learn the differences between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN` and how they combine data from multiple tables.

7. **Search and Filter**
   - Search and filter records using specific criteria.
   - Use `WHERE` clauses and other filtering techniques to find specific data.

8. **Aggregation Operations**
   - Perform aggregation operations to summarize data.
   - Utilize functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` to aggregate data.

### GitHub Repository
