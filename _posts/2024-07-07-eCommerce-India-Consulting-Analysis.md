## eCommerce in India

In this post, I present my comprehensive study on eCommerce trends in India. 

### Key Insights

- **Offline vs. Online Activity**: The study shows that while offline retail activity has returned to pre-COVID levels, online retail continues to grow robustly, driven by increased consumer adoption and a more diverse product range.
- **Growth Drivers**: Factors such as increased internet access, smartphone penetration, and a broader set of product categories are significant drivers of eCommerce growth in India.
- **Consumer Preferences**: Consumers prioritize delivery time, competitive pricing, and product variety when choosing to shop online versus offline.
- **Challenges**: Despite growth, challenges such as product quality concerns, delivery logistics, and return processes remain critical areas for improvement.
