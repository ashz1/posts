## Getting to Know SQL

### Introduction

In the early days of relational database management systems (RDBMS), there was no standard language for performing relational operations on data. Various companies developed their own languages for their RDBMS products, leading to incompatibilities and market competition. This fragmented landscape set the stage for the emergence of SQL, which has since become the standard language for interacting with relational databases.

### The Origins of SQL

SQL, originally named SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was developed by IBM in the 1970s. Dr. Edgar F. Codd, an IBM employee, proposed the relational database model, but IBM's initial support for the model was lukewarm due to its existing hierarchical DBMS, IMS. It wasn't until the release of IBM's System/38 in the late 1970s and the introduction of Oracle's RDBMS in 1979 that SQL began gaining traction.

### Understanding SQL

SQL is a software tool designed to manage and manipulate relational database data. It allows users to create and destroy databases, modify their structure, and perform queries to retrieve data. While SQL is a powerful tool for data manipulation, it is considered a data sublanguage and lacks the features of general-purpose programming languages.

### The ISO/IEC SQL Standard

IBM's early adoption of SQL led other DBMS vendors to follow suit, creating a de facto standard. In 1986, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) issued the SQL-86 standard, followed by several revisions over the years, including SQL-92, SQL:1999, and SQL:2016. The SQL standard is now internationally recognized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

### What SQL Does Not Do

SQL is not a Turing-complete language, meaning it cannot express all possible computations. Unlike general-purpose languages like C or Java, SQL is specifically designed for data manipulation within relational databases. However, many DBMS vendors have added extensions to SQL, making their versions Turing-complete and allowing for more complex operations.

### SQL Implementations

There are several notable SQL implementations, each with its unique features and capabilities:

#### Microsoft Access

An entry-level DBMS designed for small and simple databases, Microsoft Access includes a limited implementation of SQL. Users can build databases and applications using graphical tools without needing to write SQL code.

#### Microsoft SQL Server

Microsoft's enterprise DBMS, SQL Server, requires a high level of expertise and uses Transact-SQL (T-SQL). It offers additional functionality beyond the SQL standard, providing performance advantages.

#### IBM DB2

A versatile DBMS running on various platforms, IBM DB2 includes numerous nonstandard features and requires extensive training to use effectively.

#### Oracle Database

Oracle Database is a highly compliant SQL implementation used in many of the largest databases worldwide. It offers a free Express Edition for learning and development.

#### MySQL

The most widely used open-source DBMS, MySQL offers multiple storage engines with varying levels of SQL standard compliance. Its InnoDB engine provides advanced features, while the MyISAM engine is optimized for speed.

#### PostgreSQL

An open-source DBMS known for its robustness and support for large-scale applications, PostgreSQL is supported by an active user community.

### Conclusion

SQL has become the backbone of modern data management due to its standardization and powerful data manipulation capabilities. Understanding the history and evolution of SQL helps appreciate its significance in the world of relational databases.
